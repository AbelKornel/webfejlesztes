                <p>
                    DayZ is an immersive, open-world survival video game that throws players into a post-apocalyptic
                    landscape filled with dangers and opportunities for exploration.
                    Set in a vast sandbox environment, DayZ challenges individuals to scavenge for resources, navigate
                    through unpredictable encounters with other players or hostile AI, and manage their health while
                    combating environmental threats.

                <h2 class="desc_title">Meet Others</h2>
                <p>Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make
                    friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use
                    VOIP
                    to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your
                    life
                    is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.</p>

                <h2 class="desc_title">Loot Up</h2>
                <p>Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and
                    head
                    out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in
                    your
                    secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and
                    keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full
                    hazard suit and gas mask.</p>

                <h2 class="desc_title">This is your Story</h2>
                <p>There are no map markers, daily quests, or scoreboards to help you create your story. There
                    is
                    only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown
                    virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected. <br>
                    Your task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in
                    mind
                    that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again
                    are
                    the memories of your final mistake.</p>
